# ECS What-for / How-to tutorial series 

How to implement an **Entity Component System (ECS)**
- in C-like JavaScript, no OOP inheritance hierarchies
- a "pure" ECS where entities are nothing more than IDs

authored by Nick the (Arcane) Engineer and Games Developer.

A tutorial series for those who want to understand the _process_ by which an ECS _evolves_ from a na√Øve initial implementation to something more powerful.
